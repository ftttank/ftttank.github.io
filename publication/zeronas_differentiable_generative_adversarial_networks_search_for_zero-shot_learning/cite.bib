  abstract = {ZeroNAS proposes a differentiable architecture search method for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) aimed at zero-shot learning (ZSL). ZeroNAS jointly searches for generator and discriminator architectures to enhance performance in ZSL and generalized zero-shot learning (GZSL). Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior performance over state-of-the-art ZSL and GZSL approaches on benchmark datasets.},
