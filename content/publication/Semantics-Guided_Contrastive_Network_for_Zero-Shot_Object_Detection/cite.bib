  abstract = {This paper introduces ContrastZSD, a novel semantics-guided contrastive learning network for zero-shot object detection (ZSD). By incorporating two contrastive learning subnets, ContrastZSD aligns visual features with semantic information to reduce bias towards seen categories and enhance unseen class detection. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate the model's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods.},
