  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel semantic pooling approach for complex event analysis in long untrimmed videos. The method prioritizes shots based on their relevance to the event of interest using semantic saliency scores. The approach improves the performance of event detection, recognition, and recounting in challenging Internet videos by introducing a nearly-isotonic SVM classifier. Extensive experiments demonstrate promising improvements on real-world datasets.},
