  abstract = {This paper introduces a hardware-efficient dynamic inference regime, named dynamic weight slicing, that applies to both CNNs and transformers. By adaptively slicing weights in a dense way, it achieves superior performance on several benchmarks with notable computation reduction. Extensive experiments demonstrate up to 61.5% real-world acceleration on MobileNet, ResNet-50, and Vision Transformer.},
