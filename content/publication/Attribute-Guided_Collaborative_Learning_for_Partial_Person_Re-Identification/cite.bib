  abstract = {Partial person re-identification (ReID) aims to solve the image spatial misalignment due to occlusions or out-of-views. This paper introduces an adaptive threshold-guided masked graph convolutional network, which effectively suppresses noisy keypoints and incorporates human attributes to generate more robust pedestrian representations. The model achieves superior performance on public datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.},
