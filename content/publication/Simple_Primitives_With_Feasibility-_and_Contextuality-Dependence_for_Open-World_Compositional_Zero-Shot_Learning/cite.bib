  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel model called Semantic Attention and Knowledge Disentanglement guided Simple Primitives (SAD-SP) for open-world compositional zero-shot learning. The method addresses challenges in recognizing unseen compositions by incorporating feasibility and contextuality dependencies between states and objects, leveraging attention networks and generative models for improved accuracy in zero-shot learning tasks.},
