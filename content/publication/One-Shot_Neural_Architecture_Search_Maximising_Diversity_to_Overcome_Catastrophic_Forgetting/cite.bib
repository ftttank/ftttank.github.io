  abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in one-shot NAS by formulating the supernet training as a constrained continual learning optimization problem. The approach maximizes diversity using a novelty search strategy, improving the performance of the one-shot NAS on various benchmarks like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.},
