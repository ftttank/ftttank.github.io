  abstract = {This paper presents TN-ZSTAD, a novel deep transferable network for zero-shot temporal activity detection (ZSTAD), which simultaneously recognizes and localizes unseen activities in long untrimmed videos. The network combines an activity graph transformer with zero-shot detection techniques, showing superior performance in detecting unseen activities across multiple datasets. Extensive experiments on the THUMOS'14, Charades, and ActivityNet datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.},
