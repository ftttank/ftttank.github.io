  abstract = {This paper proposes a video pivoting approach for unsupervised multi-modal machine translation (UMMT). The approach incorporates spatial-temporal graphs to model object interactions and align source-target sentences in latent space, leveraging visual content from videos to improve translation accuracy. Extensive experiments on the VATEX and HowToWorld datasets demonstrate the method's superior performance over previous UMMT techniques.},
